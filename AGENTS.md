# instructions

- run static validation after big edits and ensure no issues
- separate the ui code into usable components and reuse them, if no component matches the exact use case or needs a lot of edits to match it, create a new component for the new use case
- keep the ui simple and convenient, dont add useless pretitles or descriptions or useless text
- split js code into organized functions and file
- update the documentation after big edits to add new changes and details, avoid bloating the readme file
- use typescript types correctly and store the types into organized folders
- if there is a library that performs the same jop ask the developer if we should it or continue with our own code
- dont use icons in place of bigger images, you can use icons from the icon library for small buttons
- keep the ui unified and make sure it is responsive on any screen size
- you may create helper scripts (in `scripts/`) to automate tasks like fetching playlist details and data processing; document their usage and keep them reusable for future AI agent runs
- database is Cloud Firestore: all study materials, curriculum modules, and contributor profiles live directly in Cloud Firestore (single source of truth); never create, store, or refer to local data files (such as local JSON files) for materials, and always read and write directly to Firestore
- never add unnecesesary icons, countboxes, ui pills, or other unuseful text that only bloats the ui
- when adding or importing videos for any subject or module, always group related videos (e.g. practical parts/experiments, multi-part lectures, or revision & question-solving series by the same doctor) into a cohesive playlist (`type: 'playlist'`) with structured `videos: PlaylistItem[]` instead of leaving them lying alone as loose individual `type: 'youtube'` items; this keeps modules organized and activates the interactive in-app playlist player (/playlist/[id]) for students
